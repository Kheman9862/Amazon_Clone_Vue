## If you're using windows on your local machine, and you want to install the prerequisites at first and then add the source, follow the following steps:

- Download Nodejs
- Install Npm
- Now Dowmload/Fork this repository.

### Instructions to install the package manager:

## SERVER SIDE

Go to the server folder and then opn the git bash or command line and go to the same server folder directory and then do the following:

```
# install dependencies
$ npm install

```
This will install all the dependencies but there is one file that i have removed from this server without which it will the server end will not work. It is all the passcodes file which is removed for the obvious safety reasons. But i will tell you all the keys that i worked with in detail so that you can create your own key and start the server.

### Secret Keys

- Mongo Database Key:
To get this key you can go to Mongo Atlas create your account and the generate a key to access the Mongo database.

- AWS Acess Key and AWS Secret Key:
Same as above go to AWS website create an account and then you will recieve two different keys that needs to be Place for these two. Also remeber to keep the project name same as i kept it in my code or change the given code to your project name. Otherwise it will not work.

- Bcrypt Key:
This is the key used to crypt the password of the user. This key is randomly generated you can just randomly type in any number/text that will help in encrypting the user password.

- Stripe -Key:
To get this key you can go to Stripe website. This is a payment gateway website that will help in creating a payment gateway api which is used in my website. Now create your account and the generate a key to access the Payment gateway features.

- Algolia_Key, Algolia_App_Id, Algolia_Index:
These keys are generated by algolia website. Please visit their website and read documentation if any problems. This will help in improving your search bar.

After all of this Your Server side is good to go.

I will recommend to use Postman to see the working of the server side. I am attaching the screenshot to show you how it works.

To start the server you can enter the following in your cmd:

```
node server

```
Remeber This will run on port 3000 as it is mentioned in the code to listen the app.

## ADMIN SIDE

First of all remeber that your server side is running. Now to run this Go to the comand line and in client directory and run:

```
PORT=9000 npm run dev    
```
Ports are different so that none of them clash with each other to run admin and lient it is important that server is running.

Inside the client side you can add, remove and update products/authors/users. I am sharing some of the the screenshots of the admin side I will not be providing the actual weblink for this one because it is an admin side for the privacy.
